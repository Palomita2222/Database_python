# Database_python
This will connect to a python DataBase. It can be localhost, and also can be from a real DataBase

To use, please follow the following steps:

"pip install mysql" in command prompt
also, remove the from bs4 import BeautifulSoup, dunno how it got there :/

go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ and install msql
MAKE SURE IN THE INSTALATION TO INSTALL ALL REQUIREMENTS
Later in the installation, it will ask to create a database, users passwords and more...
Make sure to put the same user and password for everything so its easy to remember.

If all is done correctly, you should have a program that accesses your desired DB and you will be able to create tables of content and add values to them with the script I developed.

Before running code, enter the script with any text editor and modify the username, password and Database name to your custom ones. If you have a hosted DB then you can also add the url to the host section.

#IMPORTANT# For now, you can create custom tables, and in theese you can add userames and passwords to store them securely. The script is being updated soon and a V2 is coming! In the V2, the script will include customisability to the data and you will be able to append to the DB dictionaries with more than 2 pieces of data, or individual strings & numbers. For now the script saves 2 values you enter as username and the other one as password.

Thanks for everything!

EDIT: IF YOU ARE READING THIS, THE CODE IS NOT PROPERLY WORKING, I AM UPDATING THE CODE RIGHT NOW, THANKS
ANOTHER EDIT: I AM NO LONGER WORKING ON IT :(, You can still use the code as a guide, as portions of it work fine, but it just breaks when all together

# Database_python
This will connect to a python DataBase. It can be localhost, and also can be from a real DataBase

To use, please follow the following steps:

"pip install bs4" in command prompt

go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ and install msql
MAKE SURE IN THE INSTALATION TO INSTALL ALL REQUIREMENTS
Later in the installation, it will ask to create a database, users passwords and more...
Make sure to put the same user and password for everything so its easy to remember.

If all is done correctly, you should have a program that accesses your desired DB and you will be able to create tables of content and add values to them with the script I developed.

Before running code, enter the script with any text editor and modify the username, password and Database name to your custom ones. If you have a hosted DB then you can also add the url to the host section.
